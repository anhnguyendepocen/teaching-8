    Time course x, with N time-points can be composed as a series of N / 2
    sinusoids.

    Show that.

    How to parameterize a sinusoid?  Shape is given.  Amplitude and phase.

    A sort of Fourier transform would store amplitude and phase in its
    coefficients.

    Show the sort-of Fourier transform.  Forward and back.

    Forward, use actual FT, and adapt. Back, do it long-hand by summing the
    sinusoids.

    Another way to parameterize a sinusoid - a sin plus a cos.  Show that.

    How to find the sin and cos parameters?  The dot product.  The
    correlation.

    e^i, and the full FFT.
